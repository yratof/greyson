*Greyson* (main character) is in a shallow grave, being buried by a gravedigger (which is a robot). he suddenly wakes up and realises he’s being buried

---

he gets out and mouths at the machine, stupid piece of crap, started burying the living

---

The robot states that he wasn’t living, as he did all the vital checks to make sure of it

---

*Greyson* looks at his chest, there’s a bullet hole just below his heart

---

he lifts his shirt to see the wound, but there isn’t one. Instead, there’s a bruise and a small device sticking out of him

---

The robot analyses the device and logs it > “That is a Mk3 Heartbreaker, Originally designed to capture rare creatures without them being harmed or fighting back, it stops all vital organs and puts the creature into a state of petrifications

---

*Greyson* looks around, he’s in a graveyard. Where tombstones should be, makeshift skulls have been places down to mark where bodies are places, as to not accidentally dig up a corpse

---

Looking for answers, *Greyson* picks up his gravemarker and decides to wear it as a mask. If he was to end up down here, someone wanted him dead. Better to remain anonymous than to be spotted

---

*Greyson* is told how to escape from the graveyard and head back to the upper levels. The graveyard is at the bottom of the block of levels, it represents the ground, as much as you can when you’re in space[...]. It also doubles as biofuel for the plantation levels, rotting bodies make the best fertiliser

---

He heads for the service elevator, which although is awaiting repair from a service bot, *Greyson* plans to hot-wire it to at least get it moving upwards

---

He checks his pockets for something to help him with the hijacking of the lift: He has a set of keys, a metal star that resembles a sherifs badge thats bend out of form, a half crushed cigarette and a section of a note that reads
